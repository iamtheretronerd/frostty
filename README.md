## ❄️ What is Frostty?

**Frostty** is a cutting-edge, open-source AI pair programmer designed to live where you work: **in your terminal**. 

Frostty transforms your development workflow by integrating advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) deeply into your codebase. It understands your project structure, reads your context, and helps you write, debug, and refactor code with autonomous agentic capabilities.

Whether you are building a simple script or a complex enterprise application, Frostty is the co-pilot that keeps your flow state unbroken.

## ✨ Features

Frostty comes packed with features designed for modern developers:

### 🧠 **Intelligent & Context-Aware**
Frostty doesn't just guess; it **understands**. By automatically loading the correct Language Server Protocols (LSPs) for your project, it navigates references, definitions, and types just like your IDE does.

### 🔌 **Universal Model Support**
Freedom of choice is paramount. Connect Frostty to:
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** for top-tier reasoning.
- **GPT-4o** for speed and versatility.
- **Local Models** (Llama 3, Mistral) via Ollama for offline, private coding.
- **Gemini Pro** for massive context windows.

### 🛡️ **Privacy-First Design**
Your code is your intellectual property. Frostty operates locally on your machine. We do not store your code or context data on our servers, making it safe for enterprise and private projects.

### 🤖 **Agentic Capabilities**
Frostty isn't just a chatbot; it's an **agent**. It can:
- **Plan** complex multi-step tasks.
- **Execute** terminal commands autonomously (with your permission).
- **Edit** files across your entire workspace.

### ⚡ **Multi-Session Workflows**
Spin up multiple Frostty agents in parallel. Have one agent debug a test failure while another drafts documentation for the fix.
